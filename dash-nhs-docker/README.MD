# CS50project - NHS Visualisation using Plotly and Dash
David Griffiths's final project for the Harvard CS50 course.

>
> The reporting from the UK's [NHS digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/) team is in depth but these publications are not **interactive** (mostly excel based). My aim is build an application that allows the UK public to explore these data sets dynamically by utilising pythons visualisation libraries.

## About

[![YouTube - About the application](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ADGlSa2_9aI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADGlSa2_9aI)

#### Implementation

[Dash](https://plot.ly/dash) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) were the two key technologies i used to build this application. Other libraries or tools used:

* digitalocean & docker - to deploy the site
* font awesome - for social media icons on the footer
* bootstrap - for custom css to help render layout on different devices
* Jupyter Notebooks - to do the initall exploration
* pandas - a python library that allows you to transform database


#### 111 Program Tab

3d plot of NHS areas across time and performance of calls answered within 60 seconds.

#### Cancer Survival Tab

hover over the bar cancer site to filter the below time series and donought charts.

## Jupyter Notebooks

I used [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to initially explore data sets.  

[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) only render static html images on github. To view the jupyter notebooks i recommend pasting the link of the github notebook into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) e.g. https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wisemuffin/CS50project/blob/master/jupyter%20notebooks/NHS_111_Programme.ipynb

However if you want to fully replicate this analysis please see the last section on how to replicate this analysis on your own machine.  



## Future Work

```
* set up [environment.yml](https://github.com/czbiohub/singlecell-dash/blob/master/README.md) so others can use
* get more ideas from the [plotly community](https://community.plot.ly/t/show-and-tell-community-thread-tada/7554)
* could add table from https://github.com/jackdbd/dash-earthquakes
* could add some graphs from mapbox
* think about layout for different devices
```
